                    I'm Juan Manuel Benitez, a Software Engineer with a strong focus on C# and .NET technologies. 
                    Currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering at Western Governors University, 
                    I'm passionate about creating clean, maintainable code that solves real-world problems.

                <p>
                    My educational journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in software development principles, 
                    Agile methodologies, test-driven development, and continuous integration/continuous delivery. 
                    I enjoy the entire software development lifecycle, from initial planning and design to implementation and maintenance.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, I'm constantly learning about new technologies and approaches to software development.
                    I believe in writing code that is not only functional but also clean, scalable, and maintainable.
